/**
 * Re-sync a tracked season against fresh TMDB metadata — the GUI equivalent of
 * the original skill's Type 3 `db.sync_all(tmdb)`. Without this, a season's
 * `latestAiredEpisode` is frozen at tracking time and the sweep can never
 * discover episodes that aired AFTER tracking began.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - `totalEpisodes` only ever advances (max). `latestAiredEpisode` follows fresh
 *   TMDB metadata in both directions so a bad read (including the old future-date
 *   bug) can heal; the floor keeps obtained episodes aired and is capped by the
 *   stored count, so it never raises the count and provider-ahead episodes remain
 *   reported as ahead.
 * - Newly-aired episodes surface as aired-but-not-obtained (real gaps the
 *   sweep will then acquire); a higher total grows the episode list.
 * - Already-obtained episodes keep their obtained flag and verified files.
 * - `status` is intentionally left untouched: episodes still need acquiring,
 *   so the season must stay in whatever lifecycle state it was — only the
 *   finale (all obtained) graduates it to completed.
